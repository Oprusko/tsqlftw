# Creating a nodejs native .Net extension
This short writeup will guide you through creating a simple node.js addon

## Before we begin
1. Read [this](http://coderesearchlabs.com/articles/BNWCA.pdf) short description on how to build a simple nodejs addon on windows.
2. Download node.js [sources](http://nodejs.org/#download).
3. Make sure you have [Python 2.x](http://www.python.org/download/) installed (not 3.x).
4. Build node sources by running `vcbuild.bat'.
5. Verify that node.lib is located under the Debug/ directory.

## Creating a .Net node addon
1. Fire up VS2010 and create a new C++ Empty CLR project.
![new project](https://github.com/saary/node.net/raw/master/images/CreateClrVCProject.png) 
2. Open the project properties (Click Alt+Enter while the project file is selected) 
3. Set the project type and extension project type should be *dll* and the extension should be *.node*

4. Set the include directories as follows (replace paths with the local nodejs source path).

5. Set the libraries directories as follows (replace paths with the local nodejs source path).

6. Add a new CPP file and call it SOME_PREFIX_Addon.cpp.
This file will hold the actual addon definitions and dll entry point.
7. Open the property pages of the **new CPP file** you created.
8. Change the "Common Language Runtime Support" option to **No Common Language RunTime Support**

## What's next?
* use the project provided here as an initial implementation.
* take a look at the following [html presentation](http://kkaefer.github.com/node-cpp-modules/#api-how-hard-to-misuse).
the ppt explains the different steps necessary to register a class with V8.
* start rocking!
